Find the degree to which seasonal trends influence COVID 19 morbidity.

# Initial Data Intake
<!-- Was the source and a short description of the data provided? -->


# Method
Map each area of examination to their latitude
Fit yearly data to $y=C_{periodic\ amplitude}*sin(t/.5yr+C_{offset})+C_{yearly\ average}+C_{trend\ for\ that\ year}*t$
Correlate latitude of countries to their periodic amplitude

# Conclusion

## Bias and Mitigation
